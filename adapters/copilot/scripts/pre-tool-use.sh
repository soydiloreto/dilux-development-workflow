# DDW — Copilot CLI · preToolUse: refuse a write that would break the FSM.
#
# The whole job is: hand the event to the shared gate without touching it. The
# previous version read stdin into a variable first, so by the time the
# validator ran there was nothing left to read; it saw an empty envelope, exited
# 0, and every illegal transition went through. Copilot looked installed and
# enforced nothing.
#
# `--dialect copilot` covers the second half: Copilot's envelope is camelCase
# (`toolName`/`toolArgs`), and its refusal is a JSON verdict on stdout as well
# as exit 2.
